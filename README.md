# Songr Application

Songr Appliction is a simple web app that is an exercise in using Spring

## How to Use the Application 

"http://localhost:8080/" : This is the splash page, I added navigation

"http://localhost:8080/hello": Simply prints hello

"http://localhost:8080/capitalize/hello": Prints a capitalized hello

"http://localhost:8080/capitalize/your%20input%20here": Allows you to capitalize whatever input
